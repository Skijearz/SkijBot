# Outdated and Archived

First version and tests of a Discord bot written in Python using the `discord.py` library. Its outdated and not longer used - current version is my Foop Bot: [Foop](https://github.com/Skijearz/FoopBot)

TOKEN is also not valid anymore therefore it can be found in older commits.
